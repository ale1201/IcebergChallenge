## Part 1: Web Scrapping

The first part of this challenge is located in the repo, in 'Part1/main.py'. If you run this file, it is going to scrapping the information of all the Hotels in Bogota for the web page of tripadvisor. With this scrapping, a csv file is going to be created under the name 'data.csv', with the information of all the hotels; each row of the csv file has the following structure:

 *Name of the hotel, ID of the hotel, The url of the hotel page in tripadvisor, Address of the hotel, Phone of the hotel, Coded link of the webpage of the hotel, Has the hotel an email?, Calification (/50), Ranking of the hotel, Calification for different aspects of the hotel, Time stamp when the data was scraped*
